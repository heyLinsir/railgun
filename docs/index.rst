Welcome to Railgun
==================

Welcome to Railgun's documentation.  This documentation is divided into
different parts.  For Railgun users, I recommend that you get started
with :ref:`installation` and then head over to :ref:`homework`.
For developers who'd rather dive into the internals of Railgun,
check out the :ref:`framework` and the :ref:`api` documentation.

Railgun depends on many external libraries. Among all of them, the `Flask`_
web framework and the `Celery`_ task queue are the most important.  These
libraries are not documented here.  If you want to dive into their
documentation, check out the following links:

-   `Flask Documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs>`_
-   `Celery Documentation <http://docs.celeryproject.org>`_
