The <code>insert</code> algorithm of BST is always a focus in research field. Now we design white-box test cases for this algorithm.

Observe function <code>insert</code> in insert.py. Write white-box unit tests and improve the coverage rate as you can.

Note that unit test classes in Python must inherit <code>unittest.TestCase</code>, and be placed in test_*.py files.

You must make sure that your programs follow the code styles. Please upload your submission before deadlines. Otherwise there will be discounts on your scores.
