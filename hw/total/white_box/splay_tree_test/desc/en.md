<code> Splay Tree </code> is an important BST. It works efficiently and is easy to implement.

In order to improve the efficiency, we take the method which can splay two layers at the same time. Please design  white-box test cases for the <code>splay</code> method.

In order to simplify, we abandon the real program and choose to test a toy one.

We have packed the Class BinNode and the toy code into the attachment. Please choose your preferred language and download it.

Observe function <code>splay</code> in splay.py. Write white-box unit tests and improve the coverage rate as you can.

Note that unit test classes in Python must inherit <code>unittest.TestCase</code>, and be placed in test_*.py files.

You must make sure that your programs follow the code styles. Please upload your submission before deadlines. Otherwise there will be discounts on your scores.
